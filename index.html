							<td>A summer of fun turns into a gruesome fight for survival as a killer terrorizes Camp Nightwing in the cursed town of Shadyside.</td>
							<td>Cast: Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, Ted Sutherland, McCabe Slye, Ashley Zuckerman, Jordana Spiro<br><br> Director: Leigh Janiak <br><br> Duration: <u>90 minutes</u></td>
							<td>"Entertaining slasher flic which gives good homage to the genre, but plays into the same tropes and story telling techniques as all the rest." - Matty Petes <br><br>"The first one was on the OK side but this one is miles better and I really enjoyed it! The characters are deeper which makes it far more engaging. The kill scenes are just so gruesome and it really stayed true to its slasher tag and horror fans would absolutely love that. Also, you get to know a little bit more of the backstory which leaves you on a cliffhanger and desperate to watch the third one." - Carlton Tazviona</td>

							<td>"Amazing acting! I loved that they made ghost face more intimidating. Amazing job to the cinematography team for getting those amazing shots of ghost face that made ghost face stand out as not to be messed with. Story line was phenomenal and has made way for new characters, however it would have been nice to see more of Sidney and Gale but I understand that the story was taking another turn. I loved the twists, and the fact that it was hard to predict. If I could give another star I would! Thank you to the team and cast of scream especially for this one! What a movie!" - Mark O' Neill</td>

							<td>"Absolutely loved this movie! Have been a hard core Halloween lover since I've watched the movie when I was a kid, and just love Michael Myers in general! I really liked this one as well. Loved how there was a bit of comedy to it at times to add in some laughs and definitely bring the old feel from the original with a little twist. Amazing job!" - Jess K.</td>
